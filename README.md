### 🗄️ Multi-Tenant Sharding Architecture

Synapse uses a custom consistent hashing sharding layer to scale to 100M+ documents while maintaining low latency.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Indexing Flow"
        Doc[Document] --> Hash[MD5 Consistent Hash]
        Hash --> ShardID[Shard ID: 0-15]
        ShardID --> RedisMap[(Redis: shard:doc_map)]
        ShardID --> ChromaShard[(Chroma: synapse_shard_XX)]
    end

    subgraph "Retrieval Flow"
        Query[User Query] --> Route{document_id filter?}
        Route -- No --> FanOut[Parallel Fan-out]
        Route -- Yes --> RedisLookup[Redis Lookup]
        
        RedisLookup --> SingleShard[Direct Shard Access]
        FanOut --> S_All[(16x Parallel Shards)]
        
        S_All --> RRF[RRF Merger]
        SingleShard --> RRF
        
        RRF --> Top5[Final Top 5 Results]
    end
```

### 📈 PageRank Authority Architecture

Synapse leverages a global citation graph to inject objective authority scores into the vector search pipeline, overcoming the limitations of pure semantic similarity.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Global Graph Construction"
        Doc[Document Ingestion] --> Extract[Citation/Link Extractor]
        Extract --> RedisGraph[(Redis: Citation Edges)]
    end

    subgraph "Authority Computation (Async)"
        RedisGraph --> Celery[Celery: PageRank Job]
        Celery --> Nx[NetworkX DiGraph Math]
        Nx --> Norm[Normalize Scores 0.0 - 1.0]
        Norm --> UpdateChroma[(ChromaDB: Metadata Update)]
    end

    subgraph "Boosted Retrieval Flow"
        Query[User Query] --> Hybrid[Hybrid Search]
        Hybrid --> RRF[RRF Fusion Score]
        RRF --> FetchMeta[Fetch PageRank Metadata]
        FetchMeta --> Boost["Boost Formula: rrf * (1 + alpha * log(1 + pr))"]
        Boost --> Ranked[Final Ranked Results]
    end
```

## 🔭 Future Work

Synapse is architected for extension. The roadmap below covers the full spectrum of production capabilities — from million-document scale to domain-specific intelligence for legal and medical corpora.

---

### 📦 Scale — Handling Millions of Documents

The base system is designed to grow. These upgrades unlock true enterprise scale.

#### ✅ Distributed Multi-Tenant Sharding [COMPLETED]
Implemented a consistent hashing layer using MD5 to partition documents across 16 ChromaDB shards. Optimized with Redis-backed O(1) shard lookup for targeted routing and parallel fan-out retrieval with RRF merging.

#### Async Ingestion Queue
Replace synchronous ingestion with a Celery + Redis Streams task queue. Priority lanes handle urgent documents (contracts, alerts) separately from bulk archive ingestion. Kubernetes HPA auto-scales worker pods based on queue depth. A dead-letter queue with retry + alerting handles extraction failures.
```
Tech: Celery · Redis Streams · Kubernetes HPA · Flower monitoring
```

#### HyDE — Hypothetical Document Embeddings
Before embedding a query, prompt Gemini to generate a short hypothetical "ideal answer document". Embed both the query and the hypothetical doc, then use their averaged vector as the search key. Consistently improves recall by 15–30% on sparse or ambiguous queries at minimal cost.
```
Tech: Gemini Flash · dual embedding · vector averaging · services/hyde.py
```

#### ✅ PageRank-Weighted Authority Pipeline [COMPLETED]
Implemented a document authority system using the PageRank algorithm. During ingestion, a `CitationExtractor` captures hyperlinks and cross-references into a Redis graph. A scheduled job (Celery) computes weighted PageRank scores, normalizes them, and persists them into ChromaDB payloads. Retrieval is enhanced with a dampened log-boost formula: `boosted_score = rrf * (1 + alpha * log(1 + pr))`. Includes an "Authority Mode" toggle for high-credibility requirements.

---

### 🕸️ Graph RAG — Relational Knowledge Reasoning

Pure vector retrieval cannot answer relational questions. Graph RAG adds a second reasoning substrate on top of the vector index.

#### Knowledge Graph Extraction
During ingestion, run `rebel-large` (HuggingFace) to extract entity–relation–entity triples from every chunk. Store `(entity1, relation, entity2, source_doc_id)` in Neo4j. At query time, extract query entities, traverse up to 2 hops, and inject the relevant subgraph as structured context alongside vector results.
```
Tech: rebel-large · Neo4j · spaCy NER · agents/graph_reasoner.py
```

#### Community Summarization (Microsoft GraphRAG style)
Cluster the knowledge graph into topic communities using the Louvain algorithm. For each community of ≥5 nodes, generate a Gemini 3 summary. Store summaries as high-level chunks. For broad thematic queries, retrieve community summaries first, then drill into specific evidence chunks — enabling global + local reasoning in a single pass.
```
Tech: Louvain clustering · Gemini 3 community summaries · hierarchical retrieval · python-louvain
```

#### ✅ Multi-Hop Reasoning Agent
For questions requiring chained inference, implement a ReAct loop over the knowledge graph: *Thought → retrieve nodes → Act → traverse relations → Observe → synthesize*. Each hop enriches the context window. Stops when confidence exceeds 0.85 or after a configurable max-hop limit.
```
Tech: LangGraph ReAct · Neo4j traversal · confidence scoring · agents/multi_hop.py
```

---

### ⚖️ Domain: Legal

Legal corpora have unique structural, semantic, and compliance requirements that generic RAG ignores.

#### Legal Citation Parser
Extract and resolve Bluebook citations (case law, statutes, regulations) using regex + LLM fallback. Resolve each citation against CourtListener or a local case-law index. Store resolved citations as typed graph edges in Neo4j — enabling "find all cases that cite X" queries.
```
Tech: Bluebook regex · CourtListener API · citation graph · pipeline/legal_extractor.py
```

#### Clause-Level Chunking
Legal meaning lives at the clause level, not the paragraph level. A legal-aware chunker detects numbered sections and ALL-CAPS headings to split at clause boundaries, then tags each chunk with its clause type: indemnification, termination, IP ownership, liability cap. Clause types are stored as Qdrant payload filters for precision retrieval.
```
Tech: clause boundary detection · clause taxonomy · legal-bert · pipeline/legal_chunker.py
```

#### Privilege Detection & Redaction
Before indexing: (1) classify privilege status (privileged / non-privileged / needs-review) with a fine-tuned classifier, (2) redact attorney names, bar numbers, and client identifiers in privileged sections, (3) store privilege metadata in Qdrant payload, (4) filter privileged chunks at query time unless `privilege_access=True` is set on the user role.
```
Tech: privilege classifier · presidio redaction · role-based filtering · access control middleware
```

#### Regulatory Change Tracker
A daily scheduled job re-ingests monitored regulatory URLs (SEC EDGAR, Federal Register, EU legislation). Semantic diff compares new vs. old versions per section using embedding cosine distance. Sections with distance > 0.15 trigger an auto-generated change summary and push notification. Full version history is stored in PostgreSQL with an audit trail.
```
Tech: semantic diff · Celery beat · change notifications · PostgreSQL version history
```

---

### 🏥 Domain: Medical

Medical RAG requires ontology alignment, structured evidence extraction, active safety intelligence, and strict compliance.

#### UMLS Concept Normalization
During ingestion, run QuickUMLS or scispaCy to map medical entities to UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). At query time, expand the query with UMLS synonyms — `"heart attack"` → `"myocardial infarction"`, `"MI"`, `"AMI"`. Dramatically improves recall across heterogeneous terminology systems.
```
Tech: QuickUMLS · scispaCy · UMLS CUI mapping · query synonym expansion
```

#### PICO Framework Extraction
Parse clinical documents using the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome). A Gemini 3 extractor with few-shot prompts outputs structured PICO JSON per study. PICO fields are stored as Qdrant payload for structured queries: *"Find RCTs on [population] treated with [intervention] showing [outcome]"*.
```
Tech: PICO extractor · few-shot Gemini 3 · structured payload · clinical NLP
```

#### Drug Interaction Knowledge Graph
Extract drug names (DrugBank NER) and interaction mentions during ingestion. Build a pharmacovigilance graph in Neo4j: `(Drug)-[INTERACTS_WITH {severity, mechanism}]->(Drug)`. At query time, if a drug combination is detected in the query, proactively traverse the interaction graph and prepend a structured safety warning before generation — without the user having to ask.
```
Tech: DrugBank NER · Neo4j pharmacovigilance · safety pre-check · agents/drug_safety.py
```

#### HIPAA Compliance Layer
A mandatory compliance wrapper before any medical deployment: (1) PHI detection with presidio medical extensions (MRNs, dates of birth, provider names), (2) de-identification with consistent pseudonymization so cross-document reasoning is preserved, (3) tamper-proof audit log (PostgreSQL + hash chain) of every query and every PHI field accessed.
```
Tech: presidio medical · pseudonymization · audit log · tamper-proof hash chain
```

### 🤖 Agentic — Advanced Autonomous Capabilities

#### Long-Context Deep-Read Mode
When CRAG grades retrieval as ambiguous AND the source document fits within a 128k context window (Gemini 1.5 / Claude 3.5), bypass chunked retrieval entirely and load the full document. An LRU cache keeps hot documents in memory, making subsequent queries on the same document near-instant.
```
Tech: Gemini 1.5 Pro · full-doc context mode · LRU doc cache · agents/deep_reader.py
```

#### LangGraph Tool-Use Planning Agent
Upgrade the adaptive router to a full planning agent. The agent has a typed tool registry: `vector_search`, `web_search`, `calculator`, `code_executor`, `sql_query`, `calendar_lookup`. Given a complex query, it plans a multi-step execution graph with parallel branches for independent sub-tasks.
```
Tech: LangGraph · tool registry · parallel execution branches · agents/planner.py
```

#### Proactive Research Agent
A background agent that monitors RSS feeds, PubMed, arXiv, SEC EDGAR, and configured URLs on a schedule. When new content is detected with cosine similarity > 0.7 to existing corpus topics, it automatically ingests and indexes it. Users receive a digest notification summarizing what was added, configurable per-user topic subscriptions.
```
Tech: RSS/Atom crawler · PubMed API · topic similarity trigger · digest notifications
```

#### Feedback Learning Loop
Collect thumbs up/down ratings and optional text feedback on every response. Store in PostgreSQL. A weekly batch job clusters low-rated responses by failure mode (wrong document retrieved, hallucination, incomplete answer) and uses failures as negative examples to fine-tune the reranker or update retrieval heuristics.
```
Tech: feedback store · failure clustering · reranker fine-tuning · DPO training pipeline
```

### 🖼️ Multimodal — Beyond Text

#### Chart & Figure Understanding
For every figure in a PDF: (1) extract with pdfplumber, (2) send to Gemini 3 Vision to generate a structured description and extract data points as JSON, (3) index the description as a chunk with `figure_type` and `source_page` metadata. Tables are extracted as markdown and indexed as structured chunks — unlocking the 40–60% of information in documents that is purely visual.
```
Tech: Gemini 3 Vision · pdfplumber figure extraction · table markdown · multimodal chunking
```

#### Audio & Video Transcription
Add support for `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.wav` uploads. Whisper `large-v3` transcribes with word-level timestamps. Chunks are split at sentence boundaries with timestamps preserved as metadata. Citations include time references: *"According to the board meeting recording at 14:32..."*
```
Tech: Whisper large-v3 · timestamp-aware chunks · audio citations · pipeline/audio_extractor.py
```

---

### 📏 Evaluation — Measuring What Matters

#### RAGAS Auto-Evaluation
Integrate the RAGAS framework to evaluate every production response asynchronously. Metrics tracked: `faithfulness`, `answer_relevancy`, `context_recall`, `context_precision`. Scores are stored in Opik. A Slack alert fires if faithfulness drops below 0.80 on any rolling 100-response window.
```
Tech: ragas · async evaluation worker · Opik dashboard · Slack alerting
```

#### Golden Dataset CI/CD Gate
A curated set of 200 question–answer pairs with known correct citations runs the full Synapse pipeline on every PR that touches retrieval or prompt code. Metrics: citation exact-match, ROUGE-L on answer text, faithfulness score. Deployments are blocked if any metric regresses more than 5% vs. the baseline.
```
Tech: golden dataset · pytest-benchmark · ROUGE-L · GitHub Actions deployment gate
